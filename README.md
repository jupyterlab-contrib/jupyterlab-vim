Notebook cell vim bindings

## Modes

Like vim, Jupyterlab has a distinction between edit mode and command mode. Jupyterlab Command mode is when the cursor is not in a specific cell, and edit mode when typing in a cell.

This extension combines the Jupyterlab (Edit and Command) modes with the standard vim modes (Normal, Insert, Visual). So the set of modes now looks like:

1. Jupyterlab Command Mode
2. Jupyterlab Edit Mode
   - Insert
   - Normal
   - Visual

## Install

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-vim
```

or with conda/mamba:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab_vim
```

## Key Bindings

To learn how to modify key bindings see the [modify-keybinds.md](modify-keybinds.md) file.

**Please note that all keys are lowercase unless `Shift` is explicitly indicated.**
For example, `Y, Y` is two lowercase `y`s, `Shift-Y, Y` is one uppercase `Y` followed by a lowercase `y`.

## Special Thanks

From @jwkvam:

> I want to acknowledge [Alisue](https://github.com/lambdalisue) and his excellent work creating [vim bindings](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding) for Jupyter notebooks.
> I hope this extension can meet the high bar his work set.

@jkwvam is the original author of this extension - the original version can be seen [here](https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim). When that version was not updated it was updated first by @axelfahy and then moved to this community organization.

Contributions and feedback are most welcome!

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package. To install with `conda` do:

```
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
```

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the jupyterlab_vim directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm run build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm run watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_vim
```
